    <h2>What are Lifecycle methods?</h2>
    <p>Lifecycle methods serve as a viewpoint into how our built components work behind the scenes. You often need to know when
            your component is created, added to the DOM, updated, or destroyed. They provide you with methods that enable you
            trigger different actions at different junctures of a component's lifecycle. They also auto-bind to your component
            so that you can use the component's state and methods. Actions of lifecycle methods can be broken down into four
            categories:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Creation (Initialization)</li>
        <li>Mounting (DOM Insertion)</li>
        <li>Updating (Diff & Re-render)</li>
        <li>Destruction (Teardown)</li>
    </ol>
